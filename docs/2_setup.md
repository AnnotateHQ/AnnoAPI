<h2 align="center">Setup</h2>

Setting up AAPI is very easy.<br>
You can do one of two things:<br>

1. Use Github's CDN.
    ```js
    <script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnnotateHQ/AnnoAPI/master/dist/bundle.js">
    ```
2. Copy the CDN yourself from the [compiled source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnnotateHQ/AnnoAPI/master/dist/bundle.js) and add it to your website as a file.<br>

Either way, the `<script>` element should be placed in your website's **head** category.
